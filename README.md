**Seven Stones (Lagori) Game – Infrastructure & Web Application**
This repository demonstrates how to design, build, and package a web-based version of the traditional Seven Stones (Lagori) game using modern DevOps and web technologies. The project combines frontend game development, containerization, and CI/CD automation, with optional infrastructure-as-code patterns for future cloud deployment. The goal of this repository is to show how a real-world application can move from source code to a deployable artifact in a clean and structured way.
At its core, the game is implemented as a browser-based application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These technologies are responsible for rendering the game UI, handling player interactions, animations, and basic game logic such as turns, stone interactions, and player movement. Because the game runs in the browser, it is accessible on both desktop and mobile devices without requiring any special installation.
The repository is intentionally structured to separate application code from infrastructure and automation code. Frontend files such as HTML pages, JavaScript logic, stylesheets, and visual assets represent the game itself, while supporting files like the Dockerfile, GitHub Actions workflows, and Terraform directories represent how the application is built and prepared for deployment. This separation follows real-world industry practices and makes the project easier to scale and maintain.
A key part of this project is Docker containerization. Docker is used to package the game into a lightweight, portable container image. The Dockerfile defines how the application is assembled, which files are included, and how the web server is started. Containerization ensures that the game behaves the same way across different environments, whether it is tested locally, built in CI, or deployed to a cloud platform later.
To automate builds, the repository uses GitHub Actions. Whenever code is pushed to the main branch, a workflow automatically checks out the repository and builds the Docker image. This process verifies that the application can be packaged successfully without manual steps. While this automation does not create a public website by itself, it ensures that the application is always in a deployable state, which is a critical DevOps principle.
At this stage, the project focuses on build and packaging, not hosting. Building a Docker image proves that the application is valid and correctly structured, but it does not make the game publicly accessible. A public website link only becomes available when the container or static files are deployed to a hosting platform such as GitHub Pages, Azure Web Apps, or another cloud provider. This distinction between “build” and “deploy” is intentional and educational.
For users who do not have a cloud account, the project can be hosted as a static website using GitHub Pages. In this mode, the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are served directly from the repository, allowing anyone with the link to access and play the game. This approach is ideal for demonstrations, portfolios, and learning purposes, as it requires no backend infrastructure and no cloud subscription.
The repository also includes placeholders for future expansion, such as backend services, matchmaking logic, and infrastructure modules. These components illustrate how the project could evolve into a fully multiplayer, real-time game using technologies like WebSockets or SignalR, backed by cloud-hosted services. Even if these components are not fully enabled yet, their presence demonstrates forward-thinking architecture and scalability.
From a DevOps perspective, this project showcases key concepts such as version control, CI pipelines, containerization, and infrastructure readiness. It reflects how modern software teams work: developers focus on features and UI, while automation ensures consistency, repeatability, and reliability. This makes the project suitable not only as a game demo, but also as a learning reference for DevOps and cloud-native development.
In summary, this repository is a complete example of how a simple idea—a traditional outdoor game—can be transformed into a modern web application using industry-standard tools. Whether used for learning, demonstration, or future extension into a multiplayer cloud-hosted platform, the project emphasizes clean structure, automation, and real-world software engineering practices.
